# Fine-Tune-GPT-2-Language-Model

The code is a comprehensive script designed to fine-tune a GPT-2 language model using custom datasets. It begins by setting up the environment, installing necessary libraries like transformers, PyPDF2, python-docx, and torch, which are essential for processing text, handling various document formats, and training the model. The script includes functions to read and extract text from different file types—PDFs, Word documents, and plain text files—combining the extracted text from files located in specific directories. This combined text data is then saved into text files for later use.

The core of the script is the training process, where a train() function is defined to fine-tune the GPT-2 model. The function loads the GPT-2 tokenizer and model, trains the model on the provided text data, and saves the fine-tuned model to specified directories. The script separately fine-tunes the model on two different datasets, one focused on "Full_Text" and the other on "Questionnaires_and_Answers". After training, the script includes a text generation function that loads the trained model and tokenizer from the saved directories and generates text based on a given input sequence. The generated text is an example output related to "modern agriculture", demonstrating the model's ability to generate coherent text based on the fine-tuned data. Overall, the script automates the process of data preparation, model training, and text generation, resulting in fine-tuned GPT-2 models and corresponding text outputs.
